# GROUPr EVENT MANAGER

# ABOUT APP:
This is the 'GROUPr' app. Use this to see local events in the area, and add them & remove them from your profile!

# EXPO INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
Download the git repository, and then open a terminal or command prompt window, change the directory to the folder, and run 'expo install'.

# RUNNING THE APP:
Run the command 'expo start' in the terminal, and scan the QR code with your phone to run. If you are already logged in, you will be redirected to the main app page, rather then the login screen.

# USING THE APP:

 - LOGGING IN / REGISTERING: 
 This app requires a login to work. It runs off of firebase, which is a google comapny, so you don't have to worry about the app seeing your password. If you do not have an account, you can create one using the Sign Up button. Only 1 username can be used per person, meaning if the username 'Nathan630pm' is taken by someone, you will not be able to create an account using that username, or change it in the profile page. 

- FORGETTING PASSWORDS:
You did an oopsie, and forgot your password? no big deal! You can use the 'forgot password' button on the login screen & enter your email you used to create your account, hit reset password, and Firebase will send you an email with a link to the firebase website, where you can go to change your password. after you've changed your password, you may use that new password to login.

- VIEWING EVENTS:
To view events, first choose a category which will be displayed on the 'Events' page. this will take you to the category page, which will display events based off of which category you selected.

- ADDING EVENTS TO YOUR PROFILE:
After you've selected a category, you will see the list of events in that category. If you see one you'd like to go to, you can save it to your profile by clicking 'Add event to profile'. This automatically adds the event to your profile.

- VIEWING EVENTS YOU'VE ADDED:
To view events you've added to your profile, go to your profile page, and select one of the 3 categories. This will show you the events that you've added to your profile under that specific category. NOTE: this may take 3-5 seconds to load due to firebase limitations.

- DELETING EVENTS FROM YOUR PROFILE:
After you've selected a category on your profile, and you've decided that you no-longer want to go to Karen's Birthday Party, because you dont want to speak to the manager, you can remove such event, by clicking 'Remove event from profile' on the specific event.

- CHANGING YOUR USERNAME:
Navigate to the profile page, and click on the text field that says change username (it may have your username already in it, but it will automatically update when you click on it.) Enter a new username. If the username is already in use, you will see the error message above the text input 'username already taken', if it is available, it will go ahead and change your username for you, and will let you know with a green 'username changed' text above the text input.

- ADDING YOUR EVENT:
To add an event that you're having, navigate to the 'New Event' tab, and enter all the information, you will need to know the name of your event, the date it will be occurring, the time it starts, and the time it ends. Then choose a category, and hit 'Add Event'. If there are any errors, you will be notified with text above the submit button. To view your new event and add it to your profile, please see "VIEWING EVENTS, and ADDING EVENTS TO YOUR PROFILE".

    

# LOGGING OUT:
Click 'Log Out' on the right side of the header. This will redirect you to the login page, and will sign you out of firebase.

# USING THE NAVIGATION:
the app uses the tab navigation as well as a stack navigator. You can click on pages in the tab to view them, as well as clicking buttons on some pages that will redirect you to a new page.
